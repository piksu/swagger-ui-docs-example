# swagger-ui-docs-example

swagger-ui on docker with locally bind mounted swagger.yml files. A simple swagger-ui demo, where the swagger-ui is used to render a selection of hand picked api specifications.

Handy for small projects, where developers may want to keep their API documentation handy among other developers.

## Running

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
